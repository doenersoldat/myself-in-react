# reactts-vite-eslint-template

A little template to create react app with:
- React with TypeScript
- ESLint
- Vite (instead of create-react-app) -> ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€
- Docker for publishing everything as docker image
  - To build everything from scratch and create an docker image with Nginx as host call ```./docker/build.ps1```


Still missing:
- Stylelint
- A lightweight css framework (like https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
- More useful docker image scripts
